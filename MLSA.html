<h3>From Principal's Desk</h3>
Can we wholeheartedly say that the year has gotten off to a promising start with the recent incident causing a jolt to our conscience? <br>
However, this year heralds the coming of responsible, empowered youth, willing and concerned enough to take to the streets, is a sign of hope.<br>
 Empathy isn’t enough. We have to ask meaningful questions and pledge our role to make our nation safe. <br>
The need of the hour is an attitudinal change, introspection, and unearthing values and ethics that truly place us above the primitive man.
<br><br>
